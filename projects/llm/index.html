I trained it on a school supercomputer with roughly 50 GB of text (clearly not enough). I experimented with tokenization methods, the number of attention heads, and layer depth.</p> <p>Overall, the results were limited: the model mostly learned basic grammar and sentence structure (which I’m still a little proud of!). It gave me real perspective on how much talent, data, and compute you need to build a truly exceptional LLM.</p> <p>Overall, My results were clearly lacking where my model only really learnt how to understand basic gramar and sentence structure (which honestly I am at least a little proud of that). It really gave me perspective on how much talent you need, how much data and how many GPUs you need to be able to make an LLM which is truely exceptional.</p> <p>Below is some generated text from my model so you can have a laugh:</p> <blockquote> <p> Generated text: !
