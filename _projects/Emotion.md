## Summary

This project has a special spot in my heart because it was my introduction to AI. I built a CNN to detect emotion, tweaked hyperparameters (filters, kernel sizes, learning rate, batch size), and really dug into the math behind convolutions, padding/stride, and backprop. It was also my first real foray into Git. I was soooo stupid back then.
 
I trained on a dataset I found on Kaggle and iterated until it generalized well on a small heldâ€‘out set. Below are a few snapshots of it working.
