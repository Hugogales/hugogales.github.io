I’m Hugo Garrido‑Lestache, a Computer Science student at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE), originally from Spain and raised in London. I’m dual‑enrolled in the M.S. in Machine Learning, and I focus on AI and reinforcement learning. I enjoy building AI and doing Research Projects. I like to cook, play guitar, go climbing, build lego, watch TV and have fun.

Focus areas:
- Reinforcement Learning (Multi-Agent RL)
- AI/ML (LLMs, RAGs, Embedding Models)
